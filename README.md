# Project Description
exposhare v1 is a full stack web application with CRUD functionality. 

The aim of the project was to create a user marketplace to buy/sell/trade photography gear.


In exposhare v2, there will be a dedicated forum, photography news bulletin, transaction capability, comments, and direct messaging.

This is a passion project of mine that solves a personal problem of mine as an amateur photographer myself looking for reliable deals and a sense of community.

## Please enjoy the application!
